# Queueing Simulation Project

This project implements a discrete-event simulation of a **multi-server queueing system** with the following features:

- **3 parallel servers**
- **Exponential inter-arrival times**
- **Mixed normal service times** (40% N(10, 3²), 60% N(6, 2²))
- **Customer abandonment** after waiting too long
- **Server breakdowns** with individual downtime probabilities

## Files Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `queueing-simulation_code.py` | Full simulation logic in Python |
| `queueing_simulation_questions.pdf` | Original assignment / project description |
| `queueing_simulation_report.pdf` | Final project report with analysis, plots, and results |

## Context

This simulation was developed as part of a university course in **Fundamentals of Simulation**. It explores how queue length, wait time, customer loss, and server utilization are affected by stochastic parameters and server reliability.
